    <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

        This guide assumes you have the following basic background:
      </p>
      <ul>

</li>
        <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>

      <h2>
        Python and Java
      </h2>
      <p>Python programs are generally expected to run slower than Java programs, but they also take much less time to develop. Python programs are typically 3-5 times shorter than equivalent Java programs. This difference can be attributed to Python's built-in high-level data types and its dynamic typing. For example, a Python programmer wastes no time declaring the types of arguments or variables, and Python's powerful polymorphic list and dictionary types, for which rich syntactic support is built straight into the language, find a use in almost every Python program. Because of the run-time typing, Python's run time must work harder than Java's. For example, when evaluating the expression a+b, it must first inspect the objects a and b to find out their type, which is not known at compile time. It then invokes the appropriate addition operation, which may be an overloaded user-defined method. Java, on the other hand, can perform an efficient integer or floating point addition, but requires variable declarations for a and b, and does not allow overloading of the + operator for instances of user-defined classes.

For these reasons, Python is much better suited as a "glue" language, while Java is better characterized as a low-level implementation language. In fact, the two together make an excellent combination. Components can be developed in Java and combined to form applications in Python; Python can also be used to prototype components until their design can be "hardened" in a Java implementation. To support this type of development, a Python implementation written in Java is under development, which allows calling Python code from Java and vice versa. In this implementation, Python source code is translated to Java bytecode (with help from a run-time library to support Python's dynamic semantics).
      </p>
      <h2>Python and Javascript</h2>
      <p>Python's "object-based" subset is roughly equivalent to JavaScript. Like JavaScript (and unlike Java), Python supports a programming style that uses simple functions and variables without engaging in class definitions. However, for JavaScript, that's all there is. Python, on the other hand, supports writing much larger programs and better code reuse through a true object-oriented programming style, where classes and inheritance play an important role.</p>
      <h2>Python and C++</h2>
      <p>Almost everything said for Java also applies for C++, just more so: where Python code is typically 3-5 times shorter than equivalent Java code, it is often 5-10 times shorter than equivalent C++ code! Anecdotal evidence suggests that one Python programmer can finish in two months what two C++ programmers can't complete in a year. Python shines as a glue language, used to combine components written in C++.</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
    <header>Variables</header>
    <article>
      <p>Variables are containers for storing data values. Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.</p>
      <code>
x = 5 <br>
y = "John"<br>
print(x)<br>
print(y)
      </code>
    </article>

  <section class="main-section" id="Statements">
    <header> Statements</header>
    <article>
      <p>A statement is an instruction that the Python interpreter can execute. We have seen two kinds of statements: print and assignment.

When you type a statement on the command line, Python executes it and displays the result, if there is one. The result of a print statement is a value. Assignment statements don't produce a result.

A script usually contains a sequence of statements. If there is more than one statement, the results appear one at a time as the statements execute.</p>
      <h2>if statement</h2>
      <p>Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Equals: a == b</li>
        <li>Not Equals: a != b</li>
        <li>Less than: a < b</li>
        <li>Less than or equal to: a <= b</li>
        <li>Greater than: a > b</li>
        <li>Greater than or equal to: a >= b</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.
<br>
An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.</p>
      <code>a = 33<br>
b = 200<br>
if b > a:<br>
  &nbsp;print("b is greater than a")</code>
 <p>Python relies on indentation (whitespace at the beginning of a line) to define scope in the code. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.</p>
      
      <p>The elif keyword is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".</p>
      <code>
a = 33<br>
b = 33<br>
if b > a:<br>
  &nbsp;print("b is greater than a")<br>
elif a == b:<br>
  &nbsp;print("a and b are equal")
      </code>
      <p>The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.</p>
      <code>
a = 200<br>
b = 33<br>
if b > a:<br>
  print("b is greater than a")<br>
elif a == b:<br>
   &nbsp;print("a and b are equal")<br>
else:<br>
   &nbsp;print("a is greater than b")
      </code>
      <h2>Loops</h2>
      <p>Python has two primitive loop commands:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>while loops</li>
        <li>for loops</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.</p>
      <code>
i = 1<br>
while i < 6:<br>
  &nbsp;print(i)<br>
  &nbsp;i += 1
      </code>
      <p>A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.

With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.</p>
      <code>
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]<br>
for x in fruits:<br>
  &nbsp;print(x)
      </code>

      <p>A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.

A function can return data as a result.</p>
      <p>In Python a function is defined using the def keyword:</p>
      <code>
 def my_function():<br>
  &nbsp;print("Hello from a function")
      </code>
